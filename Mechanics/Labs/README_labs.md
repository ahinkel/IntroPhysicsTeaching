### Hooke's Law and Conservation of Energy for a Mass-Spring System
Excel spreadsheet template for a Hooke's Law and Energy Conservation lab (lab5_Template.xlsx) and lab prompt (Lab5_HookesLaw.pdf).  Part I: An array of masses are placed at the end of a spring, and students measure both the mass and the amount of stretch of the spring.  From this data they can determine the spring constant.  Part II: students model the oscillations of one particular mass on a spring for a known amplitude to explore how energy changes form but is always conserved.  Inspired by labs at the University of Kentucky and Colorado College.
